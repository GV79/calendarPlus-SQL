Compilation
***********
Assuming that you are in the main folder's directory in the terminal:
make

******************
Running and Usage
******************
./main file.ics
(where file.ics is a calendar file you wish to parse)

************************
How the Program(s) Works
************************
This program implements a static library to parse iCalendar files. These files are created when make is called, and stored into the folder bin.
Information from the file will be extracted, parsed, and put through verification. Any errors encountered during parsing will result in the function
stopping and returning a value associated with that error.


*********************************
Known Limitations or Assumptions
*********************************
Memory Limits (if file is very large)
Some assumptions made in regards to formatting (ex. no need to trim spaces in the beginning, duplicate optional properties do not matter...etc.)
Assumptions made for calendar file (validity more flexible, calendar just needs to have 2 required properties and 1 required component...)
